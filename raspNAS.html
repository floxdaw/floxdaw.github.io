                    I had a complicated saga when I created my first Raspberry Pi NAS. That journey wont be documented here, but there will be a lot of learnings applied to this project to make a much more cool looking NAS that actually works for more than a few days.&nbsp;<br><br>Just to give a quick overview of my first 'try', I managed to get the NAS working with a Raspberry Pi 4 (RP4), and a SATA dock with 2x 3.5" HDD's connected via USB 3 as the extended storage capacity. The HDD's were inconsistent and would routinely disconnect, and it required a second 240V PSU. For those reasons and more, it was a mess. This next setup aims to improve on the model in almost every way.&nbsp;</p>

<br>NVME vs Sata- why couldnt I get sata working last time? Because I impulsively bought HDD 3.5"
<br>
<br>So I will go for sata 2.5", something like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Geekworm-Raspberry-X825-V2-0-Compatible/dp/B091JSRQ9C" class="text-primary" target="_blank">this&nbsp;</a>?<br>
<br>After a perplexity search, it seems sata is perfectly fine over usb 3.0. That means the above fan is perfectly usable for $66
<br> 
<br>Sent out a bunch of messages about sata hard drives, currently in negotiation. 
<br>I can probably sell my two 3.5" HDD's and the dock for partial price of a new 2.5" 
<br>
<br>Looking around I see a my passport for mac and wonder, is mypassport for mac any different to windows? No, its the same thing, just needs to be reformatted.
<br>I actually found a guy selling his 2tb drive because the packaging said "for mac", I offered to help him reformat it, will update.<br><br>Probably going to pick up one of the hard drives on Monday night. 4Tb&nbsp;<br><br>I have an idea for the aesthetics. I want to mount this in an old analog electronics unit. Anything from voltage readers to old CRT equipment. Updates to follow.<br><br>2/2/2024&nbsp;<br><br>I have decided that before I order the SATA card for raspberry pi, I may as well get a demo set up with one of my spare 126gb hard drives. Then once I have got the process working, I can order the extra parts and make the design more compact.<br><br>I have also started researching how to output some data via the GPIO pins from the pi that can be integrated into the final housing.&nbsp;<br><br>6/2/2024<br><br>I have acquired a 4TB SATA HDD 2.5" hard drive<br><br>Now I need to install Open Media Vault 6 (omv) 6 on my Pi 4, and test the hard drive. I have used omv before, and it is pretty steady and user friendly, and you can install docker applications on it, so I can (relatively) easily use the open source media server Jellyfin<br><br>For some reason, the raspberry pi imager didnt work on my computer (probably because I used a janky work around to install windows ll on a legacy NUC, but that is a story for another time). So i used my laptop for the image.&nbsp;<br><br>I followed <a href="https://wiki.omv-extras.org/doku.php?id=omv6:raspberry_pi_install" class="text-primary" target="_blank">this </a>tutorial to install omv. That was successful.&nbsp;<br><br>Then I created a new shared folder over the network following these steps:<br>1. Change your password by clicking the account icon in the top right corner -&gt; change password<br>2. I plugged in the HDD then went Storage -&gt; Disks, and wiped the hard drive (secure), this took took all night (approx 13 hours on a 4 Tb drive.) I would recommend just doing a quick format.<br><br>8/2/2024&nbsp;<br><br>3. After the secure boot, I added the drive as a file system: Storage -&gt; File Systems -&gt; plus icon. There you can create the file system, and you have to mount it.<br>4. After creating and mounting the file system, create a shared folder: Storage -&gt; Shared Folders -&gt; Plus Icon. I did this with both a "movies" and "TV" folder<br>5. Next, we need to share the folder over the network: Services -&gt; SMB -&gt; Shares -&gt; Plus icon. Dont forget to change the permissions to everyone can read write and to check "Inherit permissions"&nbsp;<br>6. I then tried to connect to the shared folder. I did this by mapping a network drive, but network discovery wasn't turned on, so I had to do that in the network and sharing centre.<br>7. I followed <a href="https://wiki.omv-extras.org/doku.php?id=omv6:docker_in_omv" class="text-primary" target="_blank">this </a>guide to set up Jellyfin Media Server<br><br>After all of that, I got the NAS working, with a Jellyfin media server that organises the media into a nice interface, and an SMB share so I can copy movies from my PC wirelessly.<br><br>NOTE: create the file structure that's in in the Jellyfin guide with share folders , then create the SMB share for your Media folder, then create the Jellyfin server. Also make sure media has the credentials "Everyone read/write". I didn't do this and spent an hour trying to figure out why windows didn't have permission to access the SMB share.&nbsp;<br><br>Now that everything is working, I recommend using the Free Commander software and it's<a href="https://freecommander.com/en/faq-file-operations/" class="text-primary" target="_blank"> queue feature</a> when copying multiple large files from your PC to the server.&nbsp;<br><br>Now that that is finished I move onto part 2.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>
